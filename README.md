*	make sure that when the user exits the browser, they are removed from the collection campers.onlines- when an informal logout occurs, the user is not relinquished from the database instance (campers.onlines collection in campers db)
* when a user enters an incorrect password for any given account, clear the login form and insert a red text node which denotes the user/password issues specific breach in standard.
*	when someone else logs in while you are online, that occurance is sited in the window developer console- it would be  more robust to have a global table of online users in the view of the application interface
*	in the newsfeed, add avatar pictures next to each users post
*	in the newsfeed, fix the times so that they accurately represent the distance in time
